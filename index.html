				<h3>Per-site customizations</h3>
				<p>Promenade is a start-up offers business solutions as a the primary SaaS.</p>
				<p>One of the services offered is an eCommerce website that can set up clients with an online store in minutes.
                    Clients are initially set up with a very boilerplate website - the default build code.
                </p>
                <p>As a Front End support engineer, I step in a and create enhancements for the clients. The enhancements can be anything from simple CSS modifications to full-customized website design and functionality (using JavaScript).</p>
                <p>
                    Below are some examples of the most customized stylesheets I have created and applied for sites belonging to clients in the floral market - which is a surprisingly fruitful market.
                </p>

                <h3>User Dashboard Support</h3>
                <p>To manage their sites, we host dashboards from where clients have limited control over the content on their eCommerce sites.</p>
                <h4>Dashboard Home</h4>

                <p>As a support engineer, I don't often work on the code that generates these pages but I often test functionality across different devices, replicate/ report bugs, and offer alternate designs.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Latest Example:</h4>

				<label class="text-center">A potential enhancement for the mobile view of the dashboard.</label>
            </section>
			<section class="text-center">
				<p>I wish I could share more about the dashboard interfaces, but the other pages contain sensitive information or insight on business logic.</p>
				<p>However, I have worked on hundreds of other eCommerce sites that I would be happy to showcase.</p>
